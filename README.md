# BINARY TREES

This can be related to a hierarchy of the family from the grand parents to the grand children.

## Terms used:

1. `root` - the first node of the tree, at ``Level 0``.
2. `parent` - ``Level 1`` of the tree
3. `child` - these can be grouped in two; `left-child` and `right-child`. These are from the `parent` node
4. `leaf` - the last node with no children.
